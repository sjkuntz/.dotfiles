Dotfiles Template
=================

This is a template repository for bootstrapping my dotfiles with [Dotbot][dotbot].

To try the same, you can [fork][fork] this repository (and probably delete this
README and rename your version to something like just `dotfiles`).

In general, you should be using symbolic links for everything, and using git
submodules whenever possible.
